This project is the focus of our end of studies internship conducted in order to obtain our
computer science engineering degree. This internship was realized within Talan Tunisia, an
engineering consulting company.
The aim of this project is the design and implementation of an intelligent and automated
HR Sourcing application. The solution put forward is an application that is capable of scouring
the internet for potential candidate profiles and, using the collected data, is able to discern the
candidates that are likely to be the best fit for any given job offer.
The main goal was to create a tool that assist recruiters in finding the best
possible candidates in the least amount of time by automating the searching and matching
processes.
